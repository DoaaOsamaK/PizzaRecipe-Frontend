# Recipe Display App 🍕

## Project Overview 📖
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data from an external API and display it dynamically on the webpage. The application queries the Forkify API to fetch recipes based on a specified query ("pizza" in this case) and displays the results in a visually appealing format using CSS for styling.
